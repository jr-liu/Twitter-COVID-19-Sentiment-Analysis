# Twitter-COVID-19-Sentiment-Analysis

Recently, coronavirus is the most eye-catching topic in the world. The confirmed cases in the United States are having an exponential growth, which worries U.S. residents. People are talking about all kinds of issues related to coronavirus on social media, especially on twitter. Such issues range from testing cases to even politics, which are worthy of study. The reason why choosing twitter to do the research is its rapid efficiency to share and receive information and its large numbers of users across the country. There are great amounts of tweets when searching the keywords of coronavirus, like relevant tags of “COVID-19” and “coronavirus”, and they are updating every second. Thus, it offers a solid dataset to analyze Americans' attitudes on coronavirus. By taking a close look at the confirmed cases, we observed a huge variation among states. Since the severity differs among states, we are curious about the influence of increased confirmed cases of COVID-19 on people’s opinions and attitudes on twitter.

In that case, the hypothesis of our project is that there is a potential relationship between topics about COVID-19 on twitter and daily new confirmed cases of different states. In order to explore this hypothesis, this project will first respectively present the word clouds of trending words on COVID-19 of 24 different states via a Shiny App, and then analyze the relations between tweets topics and daily new confirmed cases through scatter plot and multiple linear regression models.
